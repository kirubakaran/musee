/**
 * Programs the museum runs live. A "sim" work names one of these and the
 * exhibit builds it in place of a downloaded image or model: a simulation
 * computed while you watch, or a shape built from published figures.
 *
 * Each program returns an object in metres with its base at y = 0 and its
 * footprint centred on the origin, like a model rung, and an update called
 * every frame with the time step and the visitor's distance. A program
 * should do little when the visitor is far: a canvas redrawn at full rate
 * for someone 80 m away is wasted on a phone.
 *
 * The palette is the museum's: ink on cream, the same sheet the equations
 * are set on, so a simulation reads as a page that happens to move.
