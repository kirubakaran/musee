/**
 * The streaming world. Every work is known from the start as a stub (its
 * place and size, from the layout); an Exhibit, with its meshes, ladders
 * and placards, exists only while the visitor is near. Since rows run
 * along time, this is infinite scroll through the eras: rows ahead are
 * built as you approach and rows behind are torn down as you leave.
 *
 * Three radii, outer to inner:
 *   unload   beyond this an exhibit is disposed
 *   load     within this a stub becomes an exhibit (lowest rung first)
 *   placard  within this an exhibit has its placards (text is dear)
 * and a memory budget: when the estimated GPU bytes held exceed it, the
 * farthest exhibits fall back to their smallest rung until it fits.
 *
 * The sweep runs a few times a second, over the rows near the visitor
 * only; the per-frame work is just the live exhibits' rung requests.
