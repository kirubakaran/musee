 * A guided first visit: a short path through the museum, one line about

 * Where you are in it is remembered in the browser, so a visit can be
 * picked up where it was left. Walking off between stops is fine; the
 * next press carries on from the next stop.
 *
 * Stops name works by id; one that is not on display is skipped, so the
