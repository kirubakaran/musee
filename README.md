# 20watts

[20watts.org](https://20watts.org): everything here was made by a
20-watt brain. A museum you walk through in VR or on a flat screen, in the browser. One open
plane, no walls: forward is later in time, and a side quest stands off to
the right of the work it belongs with. Works float at their true size, and
you can walk behind one and see it mirrored.

v1 holds ninety-three works. They run from an Acheulean
hand axe (a CC0 photogrammetry scan, 300,000 years old) and the Lion-man of
Hohlenstein-Stadel through eleven cave and rock paintings from five
continents (with a scanned cast of a Lascaux wall beside the Lascaux
photograph), the Altamira ceiling, a scan of the Deutsches Museum's
full-size replica hung overhead, Stonehenge as a model you walk into, the Venus of Willendorf, a Clovis point (another scan), a
proto-cuneiform tablet, the Nebra sky disc, an Exekias amphora, the
Rosetta Stone, the Alexander Mosaic at its real 5.8 m, the Pantheon in Rome
(a photogrammetry scan of the interior, 43 m across, that you walk into
through its door and stand under the oculus), the Chi Rho page of
the Book of Kells, Fan Kuan's *Travelers Among Mountains and Streams*, a
Benin plaque, Leonardo's *Last Supper* at 8.8 × 4.6 m, Lilienthal's 1894
glider (a scan of the Deutsches Museum's replica, hung in the air), the 1903 Wright
Flyer and the Apollo 11 command module *Columbia* as Smithsonian 3D scans,
and from India the Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-daro, a Tamil-Brahmi rock
inscription near Madurai, the Iron Pillar of Delhi, a Padmapani from
Ajanta, a palm-leaf Tirukkural, the Descent of the Ganges relief at
Mamallapuram hung at its real 29 m, and the Brihadisvara Temple at
Thanjavur, a
Lunar Roving Vehicle (the Deutsches Museum's reconstruction of its replica), a
1924 Ford Model T, bombe drums, the first transistor, the Apple I, a
Cray-1, an Apple II, a Commodore 64 (a photogrammetry scan), an Apple IIc
with the MOS 6502 and its die beside it as the first side quest,
a Macintosh Plus (the Deutsches Museum's own, scanned), and the rickroll, a frozen frame of Rick Astley at the size of a living-room
television that starts to move when you walk up to it. The first iPhone is
a CC BY artist's model from Sketchfab, standing at its true 11 cm. Ten
equations hang among them as typeset sheets, from the Pythagorean theorem
in Euclid's Elements to Shannon entropy, each in the year and place it
was written down: Newton's gravitation, Euler's identity, Bayes' theorem,
Maxwell's equations, Boltzmann's entropy, E = mc², Einstein's field
equations and the Schrödinger equation, plus Brahmagupta's rules for
zero and Madhava's series for π from India. Nine pieces of music hang as
their manuscripts or first editions and play as you approach, from a
Brandenburg Concerto to Clair de lune, Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag, Caruso's
1907 record and the 1860 phonautogram that is the oldest recording of a
human voice; the Apollo 11 command module carries the landing's
air-to-ground and the rover the Apollo 16 drive. Seven works are not
downloaded but computed while you watch: the Game of Life on a slab in the
floor, the Mandelbrot set zooming on the GPU, the Lorenz attractor as a
tube you walk around with a point flying the equations live, Fourier's
epicycles drawing a square wave, a Galton board filling in the bell curve,
a Turing machine counting in binary, and the Great Pyramid of Giza at
its true 146 m, built as a stair of 210 stone courses from its published
figures, standing 600 m east of the lane where the
floor points to it, to be seen on the horizon and walked to. Four early
films play as you approach: Muybridge's galloping horse, the Lumière
train, Méliès's trip to the Moon and the Apollo 11 broadcast. Five pages
hang at their true size: Euclid on a papyrus from Oxyrhynchus, a Gutenberg
Bible leaf, the Principia's title page, Darwin's "I think" sketch and the
first page of Einstein's 1905 relativity paper. Space Shuttle Discovery
stands on her gear as the Smithsonian's CC0 scan, 37 m long; Khufu's
ship, the 4,500-year-old cedar boat from beside the Great Pyramid, lies
broadside to the lane as a laser scan drawn from 1.6 million coloured
points; and a courtyard of the Alhambra waits as a floor plan on a cream
sheet, drawn from the scan itself, and the walls grow up out of it as
you step on, since the scan is worth seeing only from
inside. The pages hang several times life size, and say
so on their placards: the idea is the work, not the paper. The sky changes near two
works: at the Nebra disc it is the night of 1600 BCE over the find-spot,
with the Pleiades low in the west and the Milky Way across the north
(laid in by hand along the galactic plane, since the catalogue stops at
the naked-eye stars), at Stonehenge the sun rises on the solstice
bearing, along the axis of the stones, over and over, and in the
Pantheon it is noon on 21 April, the sun through the oculus on the arch
over the door.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm test` runs the layout and navigation tests. The dev server is HTTPS (WebXR requires it). On a desktop browser open
`https://localhost:5173`, click to capture the mouse, WASD to walk, Shift to
run. On a Quest, open `https://<your LAN IP>:5173` in the headset browser,
accept the self-signed certificate once, and press **Enter VR**. Left stick
walks, right stick snap-turns.

Walking the whole museum takes a while, so there are hops: `[` and `]`
jump an era back or forward, `,` and `.` sideways along a row (to a work
of the same month, or to a side quest), and in VR the A / B buttons hop
eras and X / Y hop sideways; on a phone, drag to look, a stick in the
corner walks, and buttons do the hops; `Home` and `End`, or
`Shift` with `[` and `]`, jump to the entrance and the latest era. A hop lands you on the
spine in front of the nearest cell of the next row, facing the future, as
if you had walked there. `?at=<work id>`, `?at=<year>` or `?at=newest`
opens the museum in front of that work, which is handy for checking a new
addition. A stone gateway across the spine, before the oldest work, carries
one line cut into its lintel ("Behold the works of 20-watt brains") and a
plaque on how to read the floor; a new visitor arrives outside it, looking
through.

You resume where you left off: the browser remembers your place, relative
to the nearest work so it survives new works shifting the rows, and a
reload or a new deploy puts you back there. `?spawn=start` forgets it and
starts at the oldest work. `?spawn=x,z,yawDegrees` places you anywhere for
debugging, e.g. `?spawn=0,-11,180` looks at the back of the first work.

To check a render without a headset, `node scripts/dev/screenshot.mjs
<url> out.png` starts a headless Chrome, takes one capture and kills it.
It is bounded on purpose: the museum renders continuously, and a stray
headless Chrome on software GL will peg several cores until it is killed.

## Streaming

Every work is known from the start only as a stub, its place and size from
the layout. `src/world/stream.ts` builds an exhibit (meshes, ladders, contact
shadow) when the visitor comes within 90 m, gives it placards within 35 m,
since text is the dearest part, and tears it down beyond 130 m. Rows run
along time, so this is infinite scroll through the eras, and the sweep
looks only at rows within reach. A memory budget, 384 MB estimated GPU
bytes on a headset or phone and 1.5 GB on a desktop, makes the farthest
exhibits fall back to their smallest rung when it is exceeded; the ladders
in `src/assets/` know how to shrink. Hops and `?at=` work from the stubs,
so a jump builds its surroundings on the next sweep. `?debug` logs the
count of live exhibits and the bytes held every two seconds, and
`?budgetMB=` overrides the budget for testing.

### Ground and sky

The floor is polished concrete drawn procedurally: one tile per layout
cell with hairline joints every 4 m and a firmer line on the 16 m cell
boundary, so the grid of rows shows without labels. The sky is
a gradient dome, warm at the horizon and cooler overhead, with the fog
matched to the horizon. Lighting is a CC0 overcast HDRI from Poly Haven
used only as the environment map, plus a soft directional light that casts
shadows for 3D objects and follows the visitor. Paintings opt out of tone
mapping so their colours stay as scanned.

### Axes

The time axis is ordered, not to scale. Works are binned by date, to the
month when the record has one; only non-empty bins become rows, so empty
centuries do not exist in the world. Two works a year apart stand one
behind the other on the spine; two from the same month stand side by side,
the earlier to the west (by `date.day`, then a hand-set `order`, then
`importance`). `timeBinMonths` in the layout config widens the bins to
years or decades. Geography is not an axis: every work stands on the one
lane, whatever its longitude, and the record keeps `madeIn` for the world
view, `?view=world`, which spreads each month's works by 5° of longitude
into cells, west to east and centred on the spine, with the longitude
printed on the floor.

A work with a `branch` is a side quest: it does not take a row of its own
but stands to the right of the work it belongs with, in that work's row,
with its label stencilled on the floor in front of it ("the chip inside").
Steps count outward, and a step can have steps of its own, so the Apple
IIc has the 6502 beside it and the 6502 has its die beside that. The chain
hangs off the east edge of the anchor's cell, as close as the works' widths
allow and never closer than 6 m, and anything else in the row moves over.
The sideways hop walks it. A branch keeps its own date for the placard.

Rows are only as wide as they need to be: cells are spaced by the row's
widest cell plus a gap, between 6 m and the full 16 m pitch. Along time,
rows are at least 16 m apart, and further when a row is deep, so that 8 m
of clear floor stays between one row's back and the next one's front; the
Pantheon takes 43 m of the lane and its neighbours step back. A work you
walk into carries `display.threshold`, the distance from its centre to its
door: the standing point, the hops, `?at=` and the placards go there
instead of standing back to take in the whole. `computeLayout` returns the
time ticks, each with the boundary where its label goes, and the list of
occupied cells.

Those feed the cues stencilled on the floor (`src/world/axes.ts`): the
year is printed on the boundary line you cross when you step into a new
year ("35,000 BCE", "c. 200 BCE", "1976"), once, however many months of it
have a row, since the month is almost never what matters. Nothing is drawn
where nothing stands.

### Assets

Everything is served from this host, never hotlinked. `npm run fetch-assets`
reads the collection, fetches each imported asset from its source, and
writes a ladder of qualities to `public/assets/<id>/`, recording the rungs
back into `collection.json`. Each artwork may hold several asset versions
(imports, user uploads) with their own credit and moderation state;
`currentVersionId` picks the one shown.

Every source file lands in `data/originals/<id>/`, the archive of record:
written once, never modified, and the one thing to back up, since the
rungs can always be rebuilt from it. It is gitignored; at release both the
originals and the served rungs move to the server's data directory, with
the originals mirrored to a bucket. The rungs under `public/assets` are a
proof-of-concept convenience so a clone runs without a build step.

The client prepends `VITE_ASSET_BASE` to every rung path, so the same
catalogue works from the dev server, the production host, or a bucket.
See `.env.example`.

- **Images** from Wikimedia Commons: the Commons API is asked for a ladder
  of thumbnail widths, saved as `<width>.jpg`. A page of a multipage file
  (a djvu or pdf) is named by its page rendering URL, and the ladder is
  rendered from that page.
- **Simulations** (kind `sim`, provenance `procedural`): nothing is
  fetched. The version names a program in `src/sims/` and its parameters,
  and the exhibit runs it in place, with the record's `bounds` as its
  footprint.
- **Moving images** (provenance `video-still`): the source video sits in
  `data/originals/<id>/`. ffmpeg cuts the still at `loop.start` into the
  usual JPEG ladder and encodes a silent 640 px H.264 loop of
  `loop.seconds`; `loop.aspect` crops a film that sits letterboxed or
  pillarboxed inside its file to its own shape. The exhibit shows the still from afar and swaps in the
  loop within 14 m, so it is already moving as you arrive from the previous
  cell. Needs ffmpeg on the PATH.
- **Models from a file** (provenance `zenodo`, `sketchfab` or
  `user-upload`): the source glb or glTF is read from `data/originals/<id>/`.
  For `zenodo`, or any direct glb URL, the pipeline downloads it there
  first; for the others you populate the directory by hand since those
  sources need a login, and until you do the work is skipped with a warning.
  The ladder is built from that one file: textures are resized per tier and
  re-encoded as WebP, the mesh is simplified for the lower tiers, and the
  result gets the same metres, origin and Draco treatment as a Smithsonian
  scan. Photogrammetry exports are often unitless; `original.unitScale`
  (metres per file unit) is baked into the rungs, as is `original.rotation`
  (XYZ Euler degrees) for a scan that is not upright or faces the wrong way.
  Check the result with `/scripts/dev/preview.html?model=/assets/<id>/high.glb`
  on the dev server, which shows front, left, top and back views on a grid.
- **Point clouds**: a scan published as points rather than a mesh (the
  pipeline sees `mode: 0` primitives) is thinned instead of simplified, a
  hundredth of the points for the thumb up to a quarter for the top rung,
  with colours kept as bytes and normals dropped. The renderer draws them
  as round dots sized in metres, `pointSize` on the version at the top
  rung and larger on thinner rungs so the surface stays solid, and climbs
  the ladder by point count the way it does by texture size. Draco skips
  point primitives, so these rungs are plain; a 1.6 million point rung is
  about 25 MB.
- **Models** from Smithsonian 3D: the `original.url` is a Voyager
  `document.json`. Each of its quality tiers is a set of Draco glb parts in
  centimetres; the pipeline merges the parts, converts to metres with the
  base at y = 0 and the footprint centred, re-encodes with Draco, and saves
  `thumb.glb`, `low.glb`, `medium.glb`, `high.glb`. The renderer swaps rungs
  by texture size as you approach, exactly as it does for images. The
  Smithsonian CDN omits an intermediate certificate from its TLS chain,
  which Node does not fetch on its own, so the npm script passes the public
  Sectigo intermediate in `scripts/certs/` through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`.

### Adding a work

Append a record to `collection.json` following `src/data/types.ts`, run
`npm run fetch-assets`, reload. For a Smithsonian scan, find the object on
[3d.si.edu](https://3d.si.edu), take the Voyager document id from its page,
and use `https://3d-api.si.edu/content/document/<id>/document.json` as the
model version's `original.url` with provenance `smithsonian-3d`. Only CC0
objects go in. For a Sketchfab model, download the glTF zip from its page,
unpack it into `data/originals/<artwork id>/`, set provenance `sketchfab`,
and run the pipeline. Mark an artist-made model `representation:
"reconstruction"`; the placard then says so and credits the author, which
CC BY requires. Give `date.month` (and `day`) when the record has one; it
sets the order within a year, and `order` breaks a tie by hand. To stand a
work beside another instead of in its own time, give it a `branch`: the
anchor's id, a `step` (1 nearest) and the floor label. A second way of
showing the same work (a photograph beside a scan, an earlier example of
the same part) goes in `alternates`, with its own credit and provenance;
the pipeline builds its rungs under `public/assets/<id>/alt1/`, and the
renderer does not use it yet. `npm run fetch-assets -- <id>` builds one
work's assets instead of the whole collection. For a building, set
`display.threshold` to the distance from the centre to the door, and
`display.back: "mirror"` if the scan is of the interior only, so both sides
of every surface are drawn and it reads as solid from outside;
`scripts/dev/bounds.ts` prints a file's size and `scripts/dev/preview.html`
shows which way it faces before you set `original.rotation`.

An equation is an image record with provenance `typeset` and the TeX in
`original.tex`; the pipeline sets it with MathJax on a sheet the shape of
the record's physical size (100 × 85 cm) under the drawing named in
`original.figure`, an SVG in `data/figures/`, and renders the ladder,
keeping the equation's SVG in `data/originals/<id>/`. Date it to when and
where it was written down, and say in the description whose notation the
sheet uses when that came later, as it did for Maxwell's.

A simulation is a record of kind `sim` whose version names a `program`
from `src/sims/` (`life`, `mandelbrot`, `lorenz`, `fourier`, `galton`,
`turing`, `pyramid`), its `params`, and `bounds` in metres. Date it to the
idea, not the code. A program is a small module returning an object with
its base at y = 0 and an update called every frame with the time step and
the visitor's distance; canvas programs redraw at most twenty times a
second and freeze beyond 60 m, so they cost a phone nothing when far.

A thing to be seen from afar rather than stood in front of, such as the
pyramid, gets a `landmark`: `side` and `distance` in metres. It keeps the
row of its year but stands that far out to the side, left out of the
row's depth and of the streaming, built once at the start so it shows on
the horizon through its own longer haze. The floor at its row carries a
pointer with its name and distance; a sideways hop from that row goes
out to stand before it, far enough back to see the whole of it, and the
next hop back returns to the lane.

The sky can change near a work: `display.sky` with a `radius` and either
`stars` (`year`, `latitude`, `siderealHours`: the night sky over that
place in that year, from the bright star catalogue, precessed to the
date) or `sunrise` (`azimuth`, degrees clockwise from north, which is the
way the lane runs: a sun that climbs from below the horizon to eight
degrees and sinks again over a minute and a half) or `sun` (`azimuth`,
`altitude`: a sun that stands still and lights the museum from there).
With `display.oculus` (an opening's centre and radius in the work's own
metres) a ray is cast from the opening along the sun's line to where it
meets the model, and a shaft of light with a bright disc is drawn there:
noon on 21 April through the Pantheon's oculus, onto the arch over the
door. The scan's lighting is baked into its photographs, so the beam is
drawn rather than lit. The sky is fully
changed within the radius and back to the gallery's a fifth further out,
and the lights dim with it. Keep the radius short of the next row.
Stonehenge's record also sets `display.yaw` so the axis of the stones
lies on the solstice bearing.

A scanned interior whose outside is not worth seeing gets
`display.reveal`: metres from its centre within which its walls stand.
From further away it is cut off at the floor by a clipping plane, and
what shows is a plan: a slab the size of its footprint, ink on the same
cream sheet the equations are set on, with a metre grid and the walls
drawn from the scan's own vertices between knee and head height, the title at the far edge and
`display.invitation` ("Step into the Alhambra") at the near one. Step
onto it and the walls grow up out of the plan over a second and a half.
Give it `threshold: 0` so the hops land in the middle of it. `display.back: "backing"` on any model skins
its outside in plain plaster, for a scan whose inside textures would read
as broken glass seen reversed; `"mirror"` draws both sides as they are,
which suits a rotunda.

Rows are spaced by depth and by where the visitor stands: the standing
line of a row (set back by the widest work's standoff, or at a building's
door) is kept `standingClearance` metres clear of the row before, so a
hop forward never lands inside the previous building.

Simulations may make sounds on the spot (the Galton board ticks on the
pegs and clicks as a ball lands, the Turing machine ticks at every step)
through a `Clicker` in `src/assets/sound.ts`,
a positional node fed short bursts of noise; nothing is downloaded.

The guided visit (`src/world/tour.ts`) is a list of stops with one line
each, for a first visitor. `T` goes to the next stop and says its line at
the top of the screen, `Shift T` goes back, a phone has tour buttons, and
`?tour` starts at the first stop. Where you are in it is remembered in
the browser. Stops are works by id, in time order, and a work that is
not on display is skipped. Not yet bound to a VR button.

In VR a small work can be picked up: squeeze the grip or the trigger with
a hand near it and it follows the hand; let go and it drifts home.
`display.grab` says whether a work may be; absent, a model no bigger than
1.2 m that is not entered may be, and nothing else.

A recording goes in `audio` on the record: the original's URL (Commons,
NASA, anything direct), the excerpt's `start` and `seconds`, the
performers, and its own credit, since a performance has a copyright of its
own even when the piece is centuries old. The pipeline downloads the
original into `data/originals/<id>/`, cuts and fades the excerpt with
ffmpeg and serves it as `sound.mp3`. It plays from where the work stands,
through the browser's spatial audio, starting as the visitor comes within
`display.hearing` metres (18 by default) and stopping a few metres beyond,
and the placard carries a "Sound:" line. A model's `original.omit` lists
node names to leave out of the rungs, such as the land around a monument. Leave `display.baseHeight` null unless a
work needs a particular height: a small upright object is then centred at
1.4 m, just below the eyes, a small flat one a little lower so its top is
seen, and anything over 1.2 m tall stands on the floor.

A work whose source cannot be fetched by script, such as a Sketchfab model,
is added with `moderation.status: "pending"` and skipped by the pipeline
until its files are in `data/originals/<artwork id>/`; then run
`npm run fetch-assets` and set the status to `approved`. The iPhone came in
this way: the glTF zip from Sketchfab, unpacked into its folder.

A work still in copyright gets `copyrighted: true` and a `Fair use` licence
on its asset version. The placard then prints "In copyright · shown under
fair use" instead of a licence, and the asset should be small: a single
reduced frame or a few silent seconds, never the whole thing.

## Deploy

The site is static, so a server needs nothing but a web server with HTTPS
(WebXR refuses plain HTTP). `scripts/deploy.sh` does the rest over ssh:

```bash
# ~/.ssh/config on your machine
Host 20watts
    HostName <server>
    User twentywatts

npm run deploy            # build, sync data, publish a release
npm run deploy -- --site  # publish only the site
DRY_RUN=1 npm run deploy  # print the remote commands instead of running them
```

Under the deploy user's home it keeps `data/originals/` (added to, never
deleted from), `data/derived/` (the served rungs, mirrored from
`public/assets`) and `site/releases/<stamp>-<commit>/`, with `site/current`
a symlink swapped in one rename. The last five releases stay for rollback.
The web server maps `/` to `site/current` and `/assets/` to `data/derived`;
Vite's bundle lives under `/app/` so the two never collide.
`deploy/20watts.nginx.conf` is that mapping for nginx (install it, then
`certbot --nginx` for TLS, which WebXR requires). Set `DEPLOY_HOST` to use
another ssh alias.
